## Project T-shirt

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Udacity and SUSE Cloud Native Foundations Scholarship Project T-Shirt!

### Submit a t-shirt design
Update this repository with two pieces of information:
1. Add the file to the `tshirt_designs` folder. Acceptable file formats are PNG, JPG, and GIF.
2. Update the `Project-Tshirt_Design_List.md` file located in the `tshirt_designs` folder. We want to make sure that folks get credit for their work!
